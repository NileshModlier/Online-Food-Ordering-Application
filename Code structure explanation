### Code Structure Explanation

The code is structured to follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it modular and easy to maintain. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

#### 1. **Classes and Objects**
- **Category**: Represents a category of food items (e.g., Main Course, Beverages, Salad). Each category has a list of items.
- **Item**: Represents an individual food item with a name and price.
- **User**: Represents a user with a username, password, and a list of orders.
- **Order**: Represents an order placed by a user, containing a list of items and an order status.

#### 2. **Stacks and Queues**
- **OrderHistory**: Uses a stack to manage the history of orders. The stack allows for easy retrieval of the most recent orders.
- **OrderQueue**: Uses a queue to manage the processing of orders. The queue ensures that orders are processed in the order they were placed (FIFO - First In, First Out).

#### 3. **Exception Handling**
- **Custom Exceptions**: `UserNotFoundException` and `InvalidCredentialsException` handle specific error cases related to user authentication.

#### 4. **File Operations and Pickle Module**
- **save_data** and **load_data**: Functions to save and load user data using the `pickle` module. This allows for persistent storage of user information.

#### 5. **Main Application Logic**
- **main**: The main function that drives the application. It handles user registration, login, browsing items, placing orders, viewing order history, and logging out.

### Features to Add Next

Here are some features you can consider adding to enhance the application:

#### 1. **Order History**
- Allow users to view their past orders with details such as order date, items ordered, and total cost.

#### 2. **Payment Integration**

#### 3. **Advanced Search and Filters**
- Implement advanced search functionality to filter items by various criteria such as price range, dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), and popularity.

#### 4. **User Profile Management**
- Allow users to update their profile information, including their password, email address, and delivery address.

#### 5. **Notifications**
- Implement email or SMS notifications to inform users about order status updates, promotions, and discounts.

#### 6. **Mobile App**
- Develop a mobile application for iOS and Android to provide a more convenient ordering experience.

#### 7. **Multi-language Support**
- Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.

#### 8. **Promotions and Discounts**
- Implement a system for promotions and discount codes that users can apply to their orders.

#### 9. **Ratings and Reviews**
- Allow users to rate and review items they have ordered, providing valuable feedback to other users and the restaurant.

#### 10. **Admin Dashboard**
- Create an admin dashboard for managing items, categories, orders, and user feedback.
